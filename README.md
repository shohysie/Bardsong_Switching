## <a name="ove" id="ove"></a>Overview

<p>

With this pack you can freely switch your bard song in several songs, just like in Icewind Dale. 
Jester and Skald song effects are modified and improved to make up for them not being able to switch between songs like Standard Bard and Blade. 
Characters of all bard kits can learn Enhanced song and Lingering Song (which allows all bard songs last for 2 extra rounds) after 3,000,000 exp. 
Different battle songs can work at the same time. The same bard song has no accumulation effect, except when The Chorus component is installed, with which a battle song can be enhanced by multiple bards performing at the same time. A leader of chorus should be designated first.

## <a name="com" id="com"></a>Compatibility

</a><br>

Only BG EE series are supported.
	Compatible with any other MODs that modifies the original bard kits. Requied to be installed after such MODs, then all modifications of them as well as HLA revisions are remained.
	In component of The Chorus and The Custom AI, creature states of BACKSTABDAMAGEMULTIPLIER, SHAMANIC_DANCE and BERSERKER_RAGE_FATIGUE are used to help checking bard songs. There may be some compatibility issues with other MODs, but since these states are only used on bards, they generally do not cause obvious conflicts.

While singing the Enhanced Skald Song, the Skald himself gains an extra bonus of -6 to AC and +5% magic resistance.

  Lingering Song (Enhanced Song pre-requested): Effects of all Blade songs last for 2 extra rounds. Can be learned by all bard kits.

  Note:
  This component also modifies the problem that Enhanced songs (except the Jester) only works for the 6 teammates. Enhanced songs (except the Jester) now work for all friendly creatures within twice of the visual range, while the effective range of normal songs is also increased to the visual range (50').
  Most of the different battle songs can be effective at the same time, but when a Bard, Blade and Skald play Enhanced songs at the same time, only one of them will play a role, with the priority of Skald Bard Blade. 
  According to the original settings of bards in EE games, Battle Songs do not work on deaf creatures (except The Song of Kaudies, which relieves teammates' deafness); and the bards are forced to be visible while singing, but extra bonuses of Improved Invisibility can be retained.

>----------The Chorus----------

  With this component installed, all songs can be played by multiple bards (or their magical illusions) at the same time to gain extra bonus. 
  You need to click the "Lead a chorus" skill button of one of the bards to specify the leader of chorus. 
  When the other bards join the chorus and play the same song with the designated leader, they will get extra bonus. 
  If the other bards join the chorus but play different songs with the designated leader, their songs will temporarily become the same with the designated leader and get extra bonus in the next round. They're not necessary to have learned the song that the leader is singing.
  If there is no designated leader of chorus, there will be no chorus effect. 
  Each time you assign a new leader of chorus, the other bards stop leading chorus. 
  In addition, the lead singer must be one of the 6 team members. Clicking the "Lead a chorus" skill button of other creatures (such as magic illusions) takes not work. In this case, effects of his song can coexist with others but without a chorus bonus. 
  All bards agree to join the chorus by default. Clicking the "Drop out of the chorus" skill button ensures that a bard's song does not change with the leader of chorus. Effects of his song will coexist with other songs, but will not contribute to a chorus bonus. By clicking "Join the chorus" he can join the chorus again.
  The bonus effect of the chorus lasts only one round, and the duration cannot be increased even by Lingering Song.
  Bards with Kits from other MODs also join the chorus probably, but they can't lead or drop out of the chorus.

  The more bards in the chorus, the stronger the effects of the battle song. When the amount of chorists reaches 2/ 3/ 4~5/ 6/ 7~9/ 10, the extra effects are improved to different levels, which can be identified by red / yellow / green / green / blue / purple glow on chorists.
  The details are as follows: 

  The Tale of Curran Strongheart, which gains immunities to Charm/ Confusion/ Hold and Slow/ Feeblemindedness and Unconscious/ Berserk, Fatigue and Stun/ Maze and Imprisonment at the 6 levels. 
  The Song of Kaudies, which forces enemies around to make save vs. breath with a penalty of -1/ -2/ -3/ -4/ -5/ -6, to avoid deafness and bleeding (1 damage per second) for 1 round.
  The Siren's Yearning and the Jester songs, gain an entra chance each round to take effect, which forces enemies to save with a penalty of -1/ -2/ -3/ -4/ -5/ -6.
  For all other battle songs that provide bonus values, the bonus values are improved to 1.5/ 2/ 2.5/ 3/ 3.5/ 4 times as the original songs. (To avoid touching the lower limit of AC, Chorus of Enhanced Songs afford bonus AC vs. crushing, missile, piercing and slashing instead of normal AC)
  Extra bounses of Enhanced Songs for bards themselves, e.g. -6 to AC and +5% magic resistance, are not improved in the chorus.

>----------Allow Image Projections to Perform Bard Songs----------

In the enhanced edition games, image projections made by Mislead can no longer perform bard songs. This component changes it back to the old settings so that the image projections can sing and join the chorus.

>----------Custom AI (for bards in this MOD only)----------

  The Custom AI provides the ability to make brief attacks between playing intervals and maintain the presence of battle songs, but only for bards fixed by this MOD. 
  Select Customize Script BI#BARD in the character's Record interface. 

  Press "V" to switch in three Attackive Modes: Sing songs without attack actions / More singing than attack actions, try to keep songs effective / More attack actions than singing, with songs occasionnally expire. 

  Press "F" to force a bard to sing and attack when invisible. As a bards will be visible when he starts singing, this AI tells him to do nothing when invisible, unless "F" is pressed to give a command.
  This command ends with your invisibility, and "F" should be pressed again next time.

  Press "B" to cast a memorized protective spell, in the order of Stone Skin, Spirit Armor / Ghost Armor / Armor, Shield, Blur, Protection from Evil, Improved Invisibility (remember to press "F" to active an invisible bard) and Mirror Image.
  You can press it multiple times to add all BUFFs. Existing spells will not be repeated.

  Press "S" to switch Lingering Mode and Normal Mode. The character will greatly increase the attack chance and reduce time of singing in the Lingering Mode. 
  If your bard has acquired an High-Level Ability of Lingering Song, he will automatically enter the Lingering Mode and will not switch back. 
  If your bard gets the ability of Lingering Song by means other than High-Level Ability (such as the Bard Hat in Siege Of Dragonspear), you need to switch to Lingering Mode manually because the game engine does not provide a way to check those means.
  Please remember to switch back to Normal Mode manually if your bard lose ability of Lingering Song (such as taking off the Bard Hat).<br>
